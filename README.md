## RHEL Satellite Remote Execution

To set up remote execution, follow these steps:

1. Create a user for remote execution:

    ```sh
    useradd rexuser
    ```

2. Set a password for the new user:

    ```sh
    passwd rexuser
    ```

3. Grant sudo privileges to the new user:

    ```sh
    echo "rexuser ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL" | tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/rexuser
    ```
